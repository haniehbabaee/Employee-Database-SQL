# Employee-Database-SQL
Design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data.

## Data Modeling
Sketch out an ERD(Entity Relation Database) of the tables:

## Data Engineering
Used the information in ERD to create schema of csv data.

## Data Analysis
Once we have a complete database, we run the SQL queries to obtain the following:

List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

List employees who were hired in 1986.

List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
